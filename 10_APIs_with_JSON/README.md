# APIs with JSON

A common response format when writing an API is JSON. It’s easy to get started writing such an API with Flask. If you return a `dict` or `list` from a view, it will be converted to a JSON response.

```python
@app.route("/me")
def me_api():
    user = get_current_user()
    return {
        "username": user.username,
        "theme": user.theme,
        "image": url_for("user_image", filename=user.image),
    }

@app.route("/users")
def users_api():
    users = get_all_users()
    return [user.to_json() for user in users]
```

This is a shortcut to passing the data to the [jsonify()](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#flask.json.jsonify) function, which will serialize any supported JSON data type. That means that all the data in the dict or list must be JSON serializable.

For complex types such as database models, you’ll want to use a serialization library to convert the data to valid JSON types first. There are many serialization libraries and Flask API extensions maintained by the community that support more complex applications.
