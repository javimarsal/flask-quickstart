# About Responses

The return value from a view function is automatically converted into a response object for you. If the return value is a string it's converted into a response object with the string as response body, a 200 OK status code and a text/html mimetype. If the return value is a dict or list, `jsonify()` is called to produce a response. The logic that Flask applies to converting return values into response objects is as follows:

1. If a response object of the correct type is returned it’s directly returned from the view.
2. If it’s a string, a response object is created with that data and the default parameters.
3. If it’s an iterator or generator returning strings or bytes, it is treated as a streaming response.
4. If it’s a dict or list, a response object is created using [jsonify()](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#flask.json.jsonify).
5. If a tuple is returned the items in the tuple can provide extra information. Such tuples have to be in the form `(response, status)`, `(response, headers)`, or `(response, status, headers)`. The `status` value will override the status code and `headers` can be a list or dictionary of additional header values.
6. If none of that works, Flask will assume the return value is a valid WSGI application and convert that into a response object.

If you want to get hold of the resulting response object inside the view you can use the [make_response()](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#flask.make_response) function.

Imagine you have a view like this:

```python
from flask import render_template

@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(error):
    return render_template('error.html'), 404
```

You just need to wrap the return expression with `make_response()` and get the response object to modify it, then return it:

```python
from flask import make_response

@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(error):
    resp = make_response(render_template('error.html'), 404)
    resp.headers['X-Something'] = 'A value'
    return resp
```
